# Multiclass_clssification
In this exercise, I will get a chance to work on a multi-class classification problem. I will be using the Sign Language MNIST dataset, which contains 28x28 images of hands depicting the 26 letters of the english alphabet.
I will need to pre-process the data so that it can be fed into the convolutional neural network to correctly classify each image as the letter it represents.
